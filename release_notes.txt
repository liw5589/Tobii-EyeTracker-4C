Release Notes
Tobii Interaction Library SDK 1.0.2 - 2020-06-25


INTRODUCTION

We are proud to announce the 1.0 release of the Tobii Interaction Library! 

The Tobii Interaction Library makes it easy to use gaze for interaction! It 
also provides robust, built-in eye tracker connection management and easy 
access to standard data streams, all in a lightweight library.

For interaction, in general you want to know if the user is looking at an 
object (eg a button or game object) rather than at a certain coordinate. This 
is often called gaze-to-object mapping. The idea is that you provide the 
Interaction Library with information on where your interactable elements are 
(called Interactors in the API), and the library will provide gaze focus 
events. The Interaction Library makes the focus determination using advanced 
algorithms that take into account raw data noise, gaze offset errors, 
physiological and gaze behavioral eye/gaze effects, relative object sizes and 
z order, and more. This results in smart and stable object focus events 
without sluggishness and jitter.

The Interaction Library is available for Windows (32-bit & 64-bit), macOS 
(64-bit) and Linux (Ubuntu 16, 64-bit) and currently supports C++, C and C#.


FEATURES

The Tobii Interaction Library provides solid, region-based gaze focus 
calculations and events, as well as data stream access for Tobii eye trackers. 
This is done with a minimal performance footprint, no threads and an easy to 
use API. In bullet form:

* Region-based gaze focus (gaze-to-object mapping)
* Data streams (eg gaze point data, head pose and presence)
* Automatic connection handling
* Low resource requirements
* No threads
* Cross platform (currently Windows, Linux and macOS)
* Multiple languages supported (currently C++, C and C#)
* Easy to use with Windows WPF if you choose to use the included UI binding


FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated so that we can make the 
Interaction Library even better in the future. And we are happy to answer any 
questions you may have!

Please leave your feedback and questions in the forums on the Tobii 
Developer Zone. Rest assured that all feedback will be read!


MIGRATING FROM THE PUBLIC BETA

If you are migrating from the public beta, be adviced that some API methods 
have been renamed, and some have changed signatures, so you will unfortunately 
not be able to just re-compile. It should however, in general, be quite 
obvious which new methods correspond to the old ones.

Release Notes
Tobii Interaction Library SDK 0.7.340 - Public Beta, 2019-06-20


INTRODUCTION

We are proud to announce the first public release of the Tobii Interaction 
Library! 

The Tobii Interaction Library makes it easy to use gaze for interaction! It 
also provides robust, built-in eye tracker connection management and easy 
access to standard data streams, all in a lightweight library.

The Interaction Library is available for Windows (32-bit & 64-bit), MacOS 
(64-bit) and Linux 64-bit) and currently supports C++, C and C#.

We consider this release to be of release candidate quality. We are publishing 
it as a public beta to solicit feedback from the developer community and to 
enable us to still do API changes based on this feedback if necessary. 


FEATURES

* Multiple languages supported (currently C++, C and C#)


FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated so that we can make the 
Interaction Library even better in the future, and to make sure the 1.0 
release becomes the best it can be! It will also help us improve our 
documentation, to fill in any gaps or explain things more clearly where 
needed. And we are happy to answer any questions you may have!
